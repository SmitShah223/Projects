Title: Machine Replace Human Future Work? Content: “Anything give rise smarter-than-human intelligence – form Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands contest change world. league.” –Eliezer Yudkowsky, AI Researcher There’s denying robots automation increasingly part daily lives. grocery store, highway, everywhere. makes AI replace human intelligence? make relevant tomorrow? find answers questions more. Let’s understand Artificial Intelligence – Artificial Intelligenceor AI basically machines displaying intelligence. a machine playing chess a robot answering questions Facebook. Artificial Intelligence broken types. AIs designed specific tasks, detecting a specific type cancer. However, AIs multiple tasks, driving a car. types AIs. top, important fields Machine Learning ML, Neural Network, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing NLP. Machine Learningis idea machines prove similar a human learns a skill. Machine Learning optimization existing skill. Machine Learning fields application entertainment. Netflix Machine Learning recommend shows watch based shows seen. Neural Networksare algorithms modeled human brain. algorithms give similar results a human give. Artificial Neural Networks medical fields diagnose cancers lung cancer prostate cancer. Computer Visionis idea computers visions. things human beings potentially human beings do, depending programming, camera used, etc. Computer Vision autonomous vehicles navigation place another. Natural Language Processingis idea computers listen say. isSiri. Siri listen demands, process means, provide answer based researched. AI do, Let’s talk issue. AIs automation jobs, replacing humans do. means job loss concentration wealth selected people. a destabilization society social unrest. addition social unrest, AI improves time. means smarter, faster, cheaper implement repetitive things humans do, preparing fast food. predicted AI improve 50 100 years AI super intelligent. means smarter intelligent human earth. experts Elon Musk, end human civilization. AI potentially start a war humans, burn crops sorts tragedies reserved human functions. point, theory, stop AI thought obstacles prevent goal. means unplug machine, effect AI replace human intelligence. But, happen 10 30 years? NO! field Artificial Intelligence sophisticated human tasks humans do. Currently, AI smart empathetic humans strategically solve complex problems. AI solutions expensive tests standards implement. takes time AI improve. example, Boston Dynamics, world’s top robotics company a robot 2009 needed assistance walk. Fast forward 2019, robot walk jump objects, backflips more. addition timing, takes time price technological solution drop a point affordable. example, a desktop computer costs $1000 1999 a significantly powerful laptop exact price. AI curve. 10 30 years? AI make human intelligence obsolete? Maybe. proven earlier AI faster cheaper. happens, companies AI technology automate jobs save money, increase productivity, importantly, stay competitive. demonstrated, AI repetition machine learning. difference AI learn faster time progresses due amount data today. learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks important skills. However, AI repetitive routine tasks better, understand emotional intelligence, ethics, creativity. distinct example-IBM IBM IBM Watson program AI create a movie trailer. Fox approached IBM a movie coming AI #Scifi horror. asked IBM platform IBM Watson a trailer reviewing watching footage searching scary, Sad happy moments movie provoked quality emotions based machine programmed identify emotions a quantifiable manner. IBM Watson generate a trailer movie Morgan. result, a movie trailer created machines – Google 2018 google demonstrated AI assistance calls simple stuff. AI set appointment! fascinating understand nuances conversation. receptionist thought a human calling her. a primitive version technology. Eventually, conversations human beings do, making sales jobs obsolete. – AI generated art 2018, a Paris art collective consisting students artificial intelligence generate a portrait. generated portrait painting studying a set fifteen thousand art images wiki art. estimated worth thousand ten thousand dollars. painting sold auction thirty-five thousand dollars. However, AI replace human intelligence. a society started hard questions questioning ethics. Elon Musk founded Open AI, a research lab purpose promote discover artificial intelligence a benefits humanity. addition this, factors affect long-term outcome AI replacing human intelligence. Like, degree humans AI over? Depending field, people Artificial Intelligence them? prefer a human counterpart? control long run, secure short-term future. Strategic creative thinking ability box human. thousands thousands slightly outcomes result distinguishable action human mind ability judge experience programmed purposes a sophisticated manner AI achieve. billionaire founder Alibaba, Jack Ma famously – “AI logic, human beings wisdom”. Conflict resolution negotiations understanding complexities human-related processes ability improvise judge, equipped deal conflicts robots be. AI recognize faces images rarely successfully read feelings faces. Humans, lesser greater degrees, capable accurate analysis emotional subtext. application intuition delicately worded elusive languages, methods, properly judge a personfeels. Interpretation Gray Areas Robots computers function presented quantifiable data. However, situation enters a gray area, term refers morals, processes, definitions robots falter. Critical thinking Humans capable responding indicators quality computers are. AI system analyze documents true false statements made text, judge written analyze implication words meaning content.
