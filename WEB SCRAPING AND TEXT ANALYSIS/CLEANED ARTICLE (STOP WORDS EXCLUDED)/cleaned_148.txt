Title: Big Data Analytics Healthcare Content: Quality affordable healthcare a vision governments globe. high cost Medical service lack sufficient infrastructure detrimental vision. developed countries U.S., reducing healthcare cost agenda point politicians. India, affordable healthcare important as“Roti, Kapda Makan”in future. Technology play a big role reducing healthcare cost making efficient. vast quantity data Hospitals insurance providers. Big data play a big role analyzing data produce actionable insight. benefits big data follows, Fraud a big impact everyone. fact, National Healthcare Anti-Fraud Association estimates fraud costs Americans $33 billion $55 billion annually – that’s approximately 3-5% nation’s health care spending $2.26 trillion. example: Sometimes, providers hospitals report procedures services provided. Big data analytics insurance company discover frauds. Big data a huge amount historical data identify expected procedure service reported illness (identified diagnosis code). expected procedure code doesn’t match a billed procedure code, insurance companies tag claim a potential fraud claim. a claim tagged a fraud claim, manual examiner additional verification ensure claim submitted fraud provider. Sometimes, patients’ fake identity benefit insurance. big data, companies match patients’ information services he/she taken. services patient past medical history patients, analytics tag claim susceptible fraud claims. Traditional health care providers find difficult store a vast amount data. ever, traditional database stores structured data. Big data solve storage issue handling huge volume variety data. historical data patient reduce healthcare drastically. tough a Physician’s appointment developed countries. friends, senior director a multinational bank, appointment hip replacement surgery a waiting period months. sit a result, didn’t drive office months. waiting period drastically reduced hospital forecast number patients miss appointments.

Similarly, payment made lesser contracted amount service, payment called underpayment. Overpayment underpayment a big headache insurance companies patients. AHA data, private insurance companies consistently overpaid hospitals inpatient care decades. overpayments varied significantly years, grown dramatically past years. Overpayment underpayment happen multiple reasons system glitch, a coding error. cognitive analysis, big data predict payment amount. predicted payment amount significantly actual payment amount, system identify overpayments underpayments. world, healthcare based diagnosing presence disease subsequently treating disease present. Early diagnosis illness a major challenge. Patients diagnosis symptom evident. challenging physician treat illness illness grows a level. Predictive preventive identify individual develop a disease. forms health device iWatch capture data send hospital regular interval time. predictive analysis, hospital predict a patient develop illness. Early diagnosis illness doctors treat patients effectively a lower cost. Predictive treatment reduce number days a patient admitted hospital. inpatient treatment costlier outpatient treatment, doctors discharge patients he/she thinks condition patient serious. hospital monitor patient remotely medical sensors call patient hospital required. Big data plays a big role a person suffers multiple illnesses. Dr. Abhishek Rai, M.S. Ortho K.E.M. Medical College Mumbai, “It challenging operate patients suffers multiple illnesses. a number times, physicians aware issues patients patients aware illness”. example, it’s tough operate a person suffering diabetes blood doesn’t coat easily a diabetic person. a physician doesn’t historical data a diabetic person, he/she operate diabetic person wrongly. big data analytics play a huge role predicting disease a genetic disease. a person breast cancer, child 15-20 percent develop breast cancer. big data analytics, system identify patients suffer genetic disease request patients timely screening. Genetic diseases screened first, second- third-degree relatives reduce morbidity mortality. India, takes 2-3 days average MRI scan. Delay lack medical instruments lack qualified radiologists. problem mitigated integrating Medical imaging big data. Integration medical imaging big data ensure radiologists report a short span time. Big data reduce turnaround time required reports reports. Technology convert image graphs charts making easier radiologists read report. data works principle abundance scarcity. So, data have, outcomes obtained. Thus, Big Data technology digital disruptor revolutionize healthcare sector consolidating data disparate platforms build a 360-degree view human body healthcare provider generate solutions life-threatening problems improved healthcare opportunities.
