Title: humans machines evolving work together? Content: future upcoming years humans machines work field work. upcoming days machines human being. Machines [AI technology] work humans incapable doing. Machines partner co-operate humans. professor university Washington, explained that, a result AI, demand existing jobs jobs created unimaginable today. Human workers machines work flawlessly, complementing other. Machines learn carry easier tasks processes crunching data. humans difficult. Machines AI create a great job opportunities humans future. John Kelly ll, executive vice president IBM “Man Machines working beat make a decision a man a machine independently.” future, sectors country agriculture sector, industrial sector service sector utilize machines. So, work difficult. now, agriculture purposes kinds machines called a modern farming method. major technologies [machines] harvest automation, autonomous tractors, seeding, weeing drones. a result, farms agriculture peacefully. industrial sector humans machines working increase production. types machines industries packing machines, loading machine etc. humans provide instructions machines maintain management company. robots [machines] assist doctors surgeries. instance, a doctor remote location direct a surgical robot perform open heart surgery. approaches option decision left experience wisdom doctor robot. machines make humans field? Machines push human professionals skillset ladder uniquely human skills creativity, social abilities, empathy, sense-making, machines automate. a result, machines make workplace more, humans. However, humans learn skills lives. future 80% process-oriented tasks machines. Quantitative reasoning tasks approximately 50% humans 50% machines, humans continue 80% cross-functional reasoning tasks. Harvard research machines, algorithms read diagnostic scans 92% accuracy. Humans 96% accuracy. Together, 99% accurate. Human-machine collaboration enables companies interact employees customers novel, effective ways. Smart machines helping humans expand abilities ways. amplify cognitive strengths; interact customers employees free higher-level tasks, embody human skills extend physical capabilities. research, found 1,500 companies achieve significant performance improvement humans machines work together. machine systems beyond-human cognitive abilities, fear potentially dehumanize future work. Machines automate repetitive physical tasks, part quantitative tasks programming data science. D.E Shaw Group professor University Washington, explained that, a result machines, demand existing jobs, jobs created unimaginable today. similar couldn’t imagine a web app developer decades ago, millions make a living today. Machines good tasks speed, precision, accuracy. machines good responding unknown situations making judgments. part left humans. Hence, humans machines future. Humans machines divergent skill sets that, combined transform work. Machines alreadyinfiltratedevery aspect lives, learn live them. future, human workers interact closely humans.
