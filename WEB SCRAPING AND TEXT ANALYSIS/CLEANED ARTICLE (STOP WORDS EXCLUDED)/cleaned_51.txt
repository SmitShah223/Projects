Title: Future Work: AI Entered Workplace Content: Abstract Artificial intelligence employment burning issues nowadays workers clarity head longer term. article focuses impact AI jobs explains benefits AI workplace. hit a nerve. However, change article highlights reasons fear AI. AI? AI abbreviation Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence defined a set technologies brought permit machines act appears human-like levels intelligence. includes learning rules required make decisions reasoning arrive conclusions, learning past experiences, self-correction. AI types. Narrow/Weak AI – AI solution designed trained a specific task. Strong AI – AI solution intelligence matches a human brain multiple & differentiated task. Key Moments AI Journey 1940 Expectations machines match humans terms general intelligence. that, machines capability find out, Reason, React. 1950 Alan Turing develops Turing Test; a test determine a machine intelligent.However, wasn’t 60 years program deemed passed. 1955 time a computer virus defeats a person’s World Champion a parlor game. 1956 John McCarthy invents term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ held primary Academic Conference subject AI. 1962 Arthur Samuel‘s machine learning checkers (draughts) program, beat a checkers master. 1980 Reinforcement Learning introduced. a kind programming rewards punishments coach a machine interact environment. 2012 A research group led Geoffrey Hinton wins Image Net competition – competition requires AI categorize 1.2 million images 10,000 categories. level accuracy adequate typical human completing equivalent task manually. 2014 Eugene Goostman’s chatbot, a bot pretending a 13-year-old boy, supposedly passes Turing Test, a test passed before! controversy arose claim as: 1. Experts claim lasted minutes. 2. deemed biased Eugene’s mother tongue (Ukrainian) wasn’t equivalent judge’s (English), a language ways difference a person’s machine. 2018 Alibaba’s AI Model performs humans a reading comprehension test Stanford University, scoring 82.44 82.304 scored humans! Concerns AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) remain, lots people aren’t happy. all, it’s hard embrace displace 40 percent human jobs 15 years. interview CBS’s hour, Kai-Fu Lee (a Chinese AI expert) mentioned truck drivers, chauffeurs, waiters, chefs a number professions disrupted. experts, unwaveringly confirm matter noise, AI profit all. Case point, executive briefing McKinsey Global Institute revealed AI automation creating opportunities economy, society, business. said, it’s time repress widespread idea artificial intelligence taking jobs.

AI create jobs relationship artificial intelligence jobs a matter hot debate, safe AI offer opportunities. planet Economic Forum report, robots AI create AI jobs displace. conclusion viable easy identify careers artificial intelligence, example, data scientists, evaluate decisions made AI algorithms eliminate biases. that, AI occupations include: Transparency analysts: people tasked classifying varied sorts opacity algorithms. Smart-system interaction modelers: experts develop machine behavior based employee behavior. Machine-relations managers: people champion greater algorithms perform well. competition jobs humans robots goes, worth noting jobs AI can’t replace. Roles leadership, empathy, delegation samples jobs safe automation. AI eliminate bias a variety challenges work Automation stir positive change workplace. AI employed recruitment performance management, workers evaluated unbiased, fact-based manner. turn, Human Resources managers essential strategic undertakings ensure balance workplace. AI HR departments machine learning (ML) discovering issues bias stem assist act faster. ML shines identifying instances bias. turn, promote fairness variety work setting. AI workplace steer business-outcome strategies impact AI business felt, expected continue longer term. A years now, AI-oriented architecture forecasted require lead assisting businesses hold operations additional comprehensive ways, shifting traditional data science machine learning models. maneuver business outcomes AI play important role multiple aspects business. telling future artificial intelligence business sure, makes sense owners evolution avoid left behind. AI boost innovation workplace longer term workforce longer term lean innovation creativity. Businesses spent higher a part previous couple years studying AI automation leverage realize results fast. statistics showing workers spend 40 percent hours work performing repetitive tasks, business automating functions automated. Automation new; machines replacing human labor areas decades. However, coming years, mundane daily tasks fully automated. Already, 39 percent organizations completely reliant automation 2018. repetitive tasks care of, employees focus energies high-value customer-oriented tasks collaboration. designs workplaces workflows change implementation AI technology. people begin figure closely machines companies strive agile. Companies implement AI business strategy experience dramatic improvements customer experiences, employees motivated. Encouraging creativity performance repetitive tasks workers fulfillment jobs well. technology, AI positively impact world web things AI working hand hand, identifying trends solving problems business world convenient sustainable. AI, alongside technologies, predicted vary planet impacting businesses run. time, we’ll ready combine human artificial brains seek solutions major global problems. easier foresee problems accuracy nip bud AI. positive impacts felt stakeholders transparent mindful technology greater good else. Robotics AI boost productivity a report PWC, 54 percent companies confirm implementation AI-driven solutions companies improved productivity. AI automation, implemented partially, unlimited potential business. Workers’ skills, attitude, training, command chain, workflows protocols a number leading productivity challenges companies face. increasing productivity, AI systems businesses chop costs, improve standard products services, make customer profiles. a result, companies higher profits, shared stakeholders dividends, reinvest back business. Improved productivity means firms ready sell products lower prices, creating demand customers job opportunities workers. Businesses can, therefore, human labor jobs created AI automated. Final thoughts impact AI jobs Artificial Intelligence isn’t showing signs slowing down. Soon, it’ll necessity life, a bit web. now, businesses beginning realize invaluable AI automation data interpretation are. machines jobs initially, roles created automation soaring years. Will, we’ve reached purpose accelerating human intelligence artificial means? knows? know, however, sought-after AI employment individuals relevant skills. There’s work machines do; so, make valuable field irreplaceable.
