Title: Lessons past: key learnings relevant coronavirus crisis Content: “The past, prepared future.” speak, world finds engulfed worst crises recent times. global COVID-19 pandemic caused never-seen-before disruption public economic life. factories shut supply chains abruptly stopped millions workers stranded, festivals suspended, families separated countries public-healthcare systems put tremendous stress. a scenario a first-time many, world pandemics a similar scale nature before, due struggle, emerged victoriously. experienced remember, SARS MERS outbreaks early 2000s presented a similar scenario, a lower rate infection, higher rates morbidity. back time, 1918 Spanish Flu brought a world world war, a standstill. Considered worst modern-era pandemics, Influenza pandemic affected one-third world’s population 50 million lives. Yet, preventive measures social-distancing, quarantine, mass-vaccinations, public support, restraint proved successful situations, effective occasional plague outbreaks world. face a similar situation today – extremely infectious virus, spread globally, confined people homes causing tremendous economic loss minute economic activity remains suspended, affecting government industries alike. past similar incidents guide industries times? governments note public-policy measures adopted Spanish flu, SARS MERS outbreak helped eliminating pandemics? Government learn? panic due outbreak COVID-19, importantly, lockdown measures deal it, similar 1918 Influenza Pandemic, commonly referred as, Spanish Flu. Large cities world put strict lockdowns, businesses worldwide a grinding halt large chunks population bedridden. consequences observed past weeks – rampant unemployment, supply shortages, heavy reliance social security systems, causing a sudden strain national economic resources. Impact & Learnings Effective transparent communications crucial tools disease control. Iran presents a great damage unleashed a media-blackout. Secondly, censorship appease masses times. long-term political impact media censorship manipulation epidemic-related facts China seen. Still, short-term international unrest dissent deteriorated international relations. risk quoting a cliché established Streisand effect, truth out, matter countries hide it. Spanish Flu spread aggravated due failure policymakers adopting effective containment measures. Research shows cities undertook measures reduce contact citizens early-1918 displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared cities failed late adopt disease containment policies. quote results 2007 study, “Consistent hypothesis, cities multiple interventions implemented early phase epidemic peak death rates ≈50% lower less-steep epidemic curves. displayed lower cumulative mortality.” 1: Contrasting Death Rates Philadelphia v. St. Louis 1918 Influenza Outbreak guess, Philadelphia late levy restrictions gatherings, parades, social distancing measures, St. Louis not. study, definition a popular phrase “flattening curve” emerging – spreading rate infection time, enabling health care systems treat people a staggered manner, line resources. And, corroborate result, graph study shows trajectories disease cities US. Hence, multiple debunking claims social-distancing & lockdown effective preventive mechanism, previous epidemics taught perform a marvelous job ‘flattening curve’. Social Distancing & Lockdown measures effective, sustained, a months, things start improve. Markel (2007), shows disastrous consequences early relaxation bans public gatherings St. Louis death rates, Spanish flu. pullback social distancing measures pursue economic interests premature caused a sudden, unprecedented surge number deaths due flu. 2: Deaths due Spanish Flu St. Louis – A Wider Picture. black & grey lines show duration social-distancing measures active. peak death rates observed cities relaxed distancing measures prematurely. Hence, crucial past artifact governments compare inconveniences public & damage caused economy due measures, benefits nation terms human life saved, make call restrictions eased. industry learn? industry played a key role obscure fight worldwide outbreak. faces fair share challenges, unprecedented times. Global industries weathered multiple natural disasters epidemics a similar scale nature. recovery-paths immense strategic implications current policy-makers offer strategic insights, helping companies chart short-term & long-term strategies. 3: graph retail sales impact SARS epidemic China 2003; earthquake, tsunami Fukushima nuclear disaster Japan 2011; MERS epidemic South Korea 201.5 phases characterise impact retail market cases: paths inevitably converge stabilization follow trajectories, swayed public perceptions externalities, case mid-autumn festival South Korea. retail sector a micro-lens, past crises show demand trends vary product categories, post crisis. categories follow trends: Demand Trends & post a Pandemic-generated Crisis 4: Demand Trends & post a Pandemic-generated Crisis[1] trends a valuable tool large scale players regional retailers means prioritize predict consumer-demand alleviate a sudden strain product supply chain arising sudden & unexpected demands. A peculiar outcome epidemics permanent instilled consumer buying trends inflicted regions, product categories – Fresh staples a sharp rise demand product hygiene & safety standards ranked higher consumers’ priority list. Hence, advantage lies producers quickly integrate changed consumer-preferences products, showcase product reliability & quality, priced competitively, prevalent context.
