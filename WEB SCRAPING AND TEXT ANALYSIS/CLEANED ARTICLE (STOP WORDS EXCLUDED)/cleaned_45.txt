Title: machine learning affect business? Content: Machine learning techniques years, recently explosion applications. fact, a recent Q3 earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai “Machine learning a core, transformative we’re re-thinking we’re everything.” they’re business making claim. past, successful machine learning algorithms required bespoke algorithms huge R&D budgets, changing. IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure, Amazon, Alibaba launched turnkey cloud-based machine-learning SaaS solutions 2015. time startups Idibon, MetaMind, Dato, MonkeyLearn built machine learning products companies advantage of. Gartner puts machine learning top hype curve, no: machine learning won’t replace employees computers suddenly double revenue. doesn’t can’t give business a competitive advantage. plenty business processes significantly benefit machine learning. machine learning change businesses operate? thing’s first: Machine learning training data training data costs money. training data labeled humans. explain. make machine learning work business, algorithm lots lots examples it’s supposed doing. algorithm a sales lead good, show lots lots examples good sales leads bad sales leads. algorithm tag support tickets show examples support tickets. localize algorithm a language collect lots examples language. instances, a company training sets in-house. example, a bunch disqualified qualified leads. haven’t labeled support tickets they’ve year. You’d people in-house en masse a data enrichment platform -label tickets. machine judgments start finding connections patterns learn from. Machine learning cheaper efficient people works well. downside works 80 percent cases badly 20 percent cases, lowering 20 percent error rate hard, impossible. 80 percent accurate algorithm save a lot money good machine learning algorithms accurate errors. Smart companies cases algorithm high confidence directly sending low confidence cases humans. Banks years. put a check ATM, algorithm decipher numbers check. sloppy handwriting ink smudged algorithm passes task a human. design pattern saves banks lots money preserving a high level accuracy. A huge benefit machine learning turn part variable cost a fixed cost. humans handle cases algorithm struggling, creating perfect training data feed algorithm. a well-studied technique called active learning turns training data labels collected cases algorithm low confidence algorithm learn much, efficiently. algorithm increasingly accurate, unit economics business process machine learning handle cases, expensive humans called toughest, rarest situations. means human machine intelligence tandem: leveraging speed reliability computers easy judgments fluency expertise humans difficult ones. sounds smart business, it’s is.
